jokr -- need a laugh ? 
====

<b>What it does ?</b> 

Jokr is a supreme means of bringing a smile to an otherwise barrenly-lacking upside-down frown wasteland. Put simply, it helps you smile .. Something we all could use a bit more of in our lives. So enjoy (and don't resist the smile !)

<b>How does it do it ?</b>

Through a primitive implementation of the MVC model, this brief program allows a terminal app to execute various commands that ask the user whether they want a picture or joke, display that which is requested, then continue on for as long as the user desires.

<b>But how do I use it ?</b> 

Well, good news, it's as easy as pie !! Simply follow the on-screen commands to choose your frown-cure: a quick yet effective one-line joke. Or a brilliantly humorous Reddit GIF. The choice is yours (but let's be honest, when it comes to smiling, there's really no wrong decision to be made here ...)

Enjoy this open-source 'Gem' of a good time !
